The helicopter drops you in the furthest point it can fly that's still the closest point between the 2 locations that your great grandfather mentioned in his letter.
You located the first point around a huge mountain range to the West. The second point seems to be located somewhere in a big net of ice gorges to the Northeast.
The helicopter will come back in a week from now to pick you up and you need to choose where to go.
You have enough supplies and the necessary survival equipment in your sled including a rifle, should the situation require it.

These are your options:
1. Head West to the mountain range.
2. Head Northeast to the gorge system.
