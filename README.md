# Lost-In-The-Vast-White
My first finished Unity project. A short Choose-Your-Own-Quest adventure type game ambienced in a research trip in Antarctica.

To play the game you only need to download the zip file, unzip it and double click on the .exe file.
Alternatively, you can play the game online at https://sharemygame.com/@OuterGazer/lost-in-the-vast-white
