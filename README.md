My first finished Unity project. A short Choose-Your-Own-Quest adventure type game ambienced in a research trip in Antarctica.

To play the game you only need to download the zip file, unzip it and double click on the .exe file.
Alternatively, you can play the game online at https://sharemygame.com/@OuterGazer/lost-in-the-vast-white

The game controls with the number keys 1 and 2. You can press q or Esc at any time to quit.

I included the story diagram in .xml in case you want to check the endings or my writing. Use it for whatever you want, although let me know if you use story bits or ideas for your own game.
